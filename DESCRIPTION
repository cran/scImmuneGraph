Description: Statistics and visualization of the distribution, diversity and composition of clonotypes, the abundance and length distribution of CDR3, the respective abundance distribution of V and J genes, and the abundance of V-J gene pairs are the basic requirements for single-cell immune group analysis. 'scImmuneGraph' is designed to process data from 10x Genomics Chromium Immune Profiling for T cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) enrichment workflows.
